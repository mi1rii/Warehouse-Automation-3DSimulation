Warehouse Automation 3D Simulation

This project is a 3D simulation of an automated warehouse system where forklift robots load packages into a truck efficiently. We used Python with OpenGL for the visual simulation and Julia to define the behavior of the agents (robots and boxes).

Project Description
This simulation models a logistics automation scenario in which:

Forklift robots navigate through a warehouse.

They detect and pick up boxes of varying sizes.

Boxes are loaded into a truck using the 3DBinPacking library to optimize space.

The behavior of the agents is programmed in Julia, while the 3D visualization and simulation control are developed in Python with OpenGL.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python 3

OpenGL (PyOpenGL)

Integration with the 3DBinPacking library

Julia

Agent-based behavior modeling
